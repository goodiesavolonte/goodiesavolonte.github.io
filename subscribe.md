_Why subscribe to Goodies à Volonté content updates?_  
Subscribing is an easy way for you to know when new content is posted to our blog. That way, you won't miss any of our delicious recipes!

_How can I subscribe?_  
There are two ways to subscribe: by Email or RSS. If you prefer email updates, we'll send you an email as soon as a new post is published. To sign up, enter your email address:
<form action="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=goodiesavolonte', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=550,height=520');return true"><input style="width: 140px;" type="text" name="email" /><input type="hidden" name="uri" value="goodiesavolonte" /><input type="hidden" name="loc" value="en_US" /> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" /></form>
