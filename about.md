I’m Cecilia, my husband Nicolas and I love spending time in the kitchen and started our food blogging adventure in 2013.

A lot has happened since then. We now have two boys. I became a certified aromatherapist, registered reflexologist and reiki practitioner. I’m currently studying holistic nutrition!

I hope to share interesting and healthy recipes with you.
