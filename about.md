Hi! I am Cecilia, the creative mind and chronic gourmande behind this blog. I am the mom of a beautiful little boy named Simon. My french husband Nicolas is a video game programmer, wine geek, and the photographer for this blog.

Food is deeply anchored in our genes and naturally we love cooking, whether it’s exploring new recipes or cooking wholesome dinners and lunches. Our secret deam is to open a bistro-café in a place we love.

This blog is about sharing our passion for food and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

Happy cooking!
