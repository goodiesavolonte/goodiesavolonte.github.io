Do you like cookies? We LOVE cookies. . . I mean who doesn't?
  
We've always been searching for the perfect soft and chewy cookie recipe. All the recipes we've tried have never reached our expectations. Not until. . . last Christmas. My husband gave me Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery book as a Christmas present. If you are into baking and making decent artisan bread then this is the right book. This book covers from classic french pastry to more modern american with great attention to details.

This recipe is adapted from the Chocolate Chunk and Chip Cookies in the book. I find the original recipe a bit too sweet for my taste. So, I've decreased the amount of sugar, but not too much to affect the texture of the cookie. With this basic cookie dough you can incorporate any ingredients that you desire like. . . pecans? The toasted pecans add a nuttiness and a nice bite and pairs well with the chocolate. I prefer to use strong dark chocolate with higher percentage of cocoa like 70 or 80%.  The recipe requires 60 grams of eggs..how do you measure precisely? I used 1 large egg plus approximately 1 teaspoon.  I simply gave the egg a light whisk just to incorporate the white and yolk, then use the scale to achieve the accurate amount.

Give this recipe a try and let me know if this is the best cookie you've ever had!!!

    <strong>Instructions</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span style="line-height: 14px;">Preheat oven to 350F and toast pecans for 5 minutes then take out from the oven to cool.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix flour, salt and sift in the baking soda in a medium bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix dark brown sugar, molasses and granulated sugar in a small bowl. Use the back of a spoon to break any lumps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cut chocolates in 0.4 inch chunks then place it in the strainer to remove any powdered chocolate. Mix the chocolate chunks with the pecans.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a scale to measure the eggs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cream the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment in medium-low speed. The consistency should be like mayonnaise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the sugar mixture and mix for 4 minutes, until fluffy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the eggs and mix on low speed for 15-30 seconds. Over mixing will affect the result of the cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the flour mixture in two additions and mix on low speed for 15-30 seconds each.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the chocolate chunks and pecans, pulse on low speed about 10 times to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Refrigerate the dough for 30 mins. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or one month in the freezer. Frozen dough needs to defrost in the refrigerator overnight and bring to room temperature before baking.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 325F. Position the racks in the upper and lower third of the oven and place parchment paper on two baking pans.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a scale to measure the dough for 12 portions (75g each).
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 12-14 minutes in a convection oven or 16-18 minutes in a standard oven.  Switch the pans halfway through baking. Bake until golden brown.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the pans on a cooling rack for 5-10 minutes, then transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely.
    </li>
  </ol>
