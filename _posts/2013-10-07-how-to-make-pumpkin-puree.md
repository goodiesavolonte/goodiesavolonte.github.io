This week we are doing a special pumpkin week. We will be sharing recipes featuring pumpkin in very different ways, from sweet to savory and breakfast to dinner. We never really used pumpkin before. It&#8217;s the kind of product that we used to ignore when grocery shopping because we misunderstand it. We would not know how to use it or what to cook with it. This time is over. We decided to give pumpkin a chance and the results were amazing.

Over the past weeks, we experimented many recipes and selected several of them to share on the blog. To make things easier, all the recipes are using pumpkin purée as a base. This way you can make a big batch and you&#8217;ll be able to try our different recipes. It&#8217;s also possible to use canned pumpkin, but making your own is dead simple and tastes so much better. It can be stored in the fridge for about 1 week.

So, hop on and join the pumpkin adventure with us!
