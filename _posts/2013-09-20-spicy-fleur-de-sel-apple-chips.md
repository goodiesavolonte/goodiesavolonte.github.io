I am an apple chip addict! They are so irresistible. Once I start eating them, I just can&#8217;t stop. I made few batches last weekend, trying different flavors and I found one I love: Spicy Fleur de Sel Apple Chips! Okay, this might sound like a crazy idea but fear not!

It is not uncommon to find salt in just about everything in Asia, especially in foods that are supposed to be sweet like candies or soda (I&#8217;ll give you my recipe for salty lime coke one day!). It helps a lot balancing out the sweetness. For example, Chinese preserved dried plum which is a popular candy among Asians. These chips remind me of that. How can I describe these plums? First, there are many kinds. Dried, candied, sweet, sour and the list goes on. But our favorites, and the ones I&#8217;m referring to, are the classic dried ones that are sweet, sour and salty at the same time. These chips have a similar taste, although less extreme.

For this recipe, you will need good quality apples. I prefer to use Macintosh. They are not the type of apple I like to eat on its own but they are perfect for baking. I preserve the natural sourness of the apple by not adding too much maple syrup. Some recipes require you to brush the apples twice with the syrup throughout the baking. I only brush the apples once before baking. The slices are then topped with a pinch of fleur de sel which is less aggressive and more flavorful than regular salt. Adding cayenne pepper makes the chips pop. It&#8217;s optional but you should give it a try, although beware, you might become an addict like me!
