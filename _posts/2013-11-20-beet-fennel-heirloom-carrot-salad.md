Last weekend we did something that we really like but that we haven&#8217;t been doing for a while. We left early in the morning to go shopping at the St-Lawrence Market in downtown Toronto. We usually do our grocery shopping at the nearby grocery stores, mainly by lack of time. But once in a while it feels good to break the old habits. This time, no grocery list and going through the aisles of the store in a predefined order. We just randomly browsed through the market, getting inspiration from the locally grown produces. I spotted some beets and heirloom carrots and instantly I was craving for a nice fall salad.

This salad is all about crunch and vibrant flavors. The beets, fennel bulbs and heirloom carrots are thinly sliced on a mandoline for the crunch part. The flavors mostly come from the vinaigrette that is also use to quickly pickle the beets. It&#8217;s very bright and zesty thanks to the addition of ground green cardamom. I never thought about using green cardamom in a dressing before but it really brings some freshness. And that&#8217;s pretty much it for this salad, nothing crazy but I always like to try new salads. This one is healthy and dead simple to make.

_Note: Please be careful when using a mandoline. It&#8217;s better to waste a little or finish with a knife than getting a bad cut. For the carrots, I use one thumb to push very slowly the back of the carrot and the other to hold it flat._
