Few months ago, we decided to start making our own bread at home. There were many reasons for this change to happen. I guess the question was: Can we buy quality bread that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, all within walking distance? If we lived in France, I would probably answer yes. In fact, Nico's parents have the chance to live near a bakery with a MOF (_Meilleur Ouvrier de France_, a hard earned title of best artisan baker) who makes wonderful bread. Their baguette is amazing and cost less than a $1.50. Such a deal cannot be found in Toronto, and probably North America. Artisan bread is just too fancy of a thing here. No one is to blame for that, it's just that bread is not as essential as it is in France.

All that wouldn't be much of a problem if I wasn't turning into the bread eaters that are my son and husband. Yes, we eat a lot of bread and it starts with a slice of bread spread with jam or butter for breakfast. My favorite bread for that is a simple whole grain loaf. It's made with equal part all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour and a mix of grains and seeds. The result is a much more healthy and tasty bread than the store-bought one. But the true wonder is that it takes little to no time to make. It takes me 5 minutes of preparation, the rest is just waiting and baking. It would take me longer to go to the store and buy it.

This recipe is for a basic loaf. It can be easily adjusted to your preferences. Feel free to add or substitute with other nuts and cereals, or even dried fruits.
