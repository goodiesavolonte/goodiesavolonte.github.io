Last week, we were posting a [colorful and fragrant salad](http://www.goodiesavolonte.com/2013/11/20/beet-fennel-heirloom-carrot-salad/) with beets and carrots that we found at the market. On the same day at the market, we also stumbled upon live mussels from Prince Edward County. As soon as I saw those mussels, I was reminded of a dish we made on our trip to France last summer. It's a very classic mussel recipe but with the addition of chorizo, and it makes a huge difference. I can't tell you how much we love chorizo. We even tried to bring some back from our trip but it all got seized by the customs back in Toronto (a cruel ending for these beautiful sausages if you ask me).

To make this recipe, you'll need to find good quality chorizo, preferably Spanish. Ideally, you'll want a sausage that is semi-dried, as they are easier to cook with than the dry-cured ones. If you can't find semi-dried chorizo, that's ok, something like [that](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KK7PKS/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000KK7PKS&linkCode=as2&tag=goodavolo06-20) will do. I personally prefer the hot version as it gives a nice kick to the dish. Finding a good chorizo may be the hardest part. The rest of the recipe is really simple, great if you have guests (do the prep in advance). I also served the mussels with garlic bread to keep things interesting.

_Nico's wine pairing: Since you'll need some white wine for this recipe I suggest drinking the same wine. Now, don't cook with your best wine, find yourself a good Albarino, Sauvignon Blanc or Vinho Verde under $15. _
