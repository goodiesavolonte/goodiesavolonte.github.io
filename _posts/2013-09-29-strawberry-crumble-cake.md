This summer has been very busy for us. We moved to a new apartment after a long time hunting for a new place. While moving is usually tiring for everyone, moving with a baby around is another level. And to make things worst, we all got sick after moving to the new place. Luckily, we had Nico&#8217;s parents to help us out. When things get really busy like this summer, it&#8217;s always nice to have easy and quick recipes to boost the troops. After all, what&#8217;s better than a nice meal after a long day of work?

Strawberry Crumble Cake is one of those simple recipes. Like its name implies, it&#8217;s half cake half crumble. The bottom is more cake like while the top resembles crumble (perfect if you prefer cakes but your husband favors crumble), with a fruit layer in the middle. I have been making it all summer using different kinds of berries each time. I like strawberries but I found blueberries worked just as well. Of course, you can go with your preferred fruits. I also sprinkle the top with almond flakes to make it a bit more interesting.
