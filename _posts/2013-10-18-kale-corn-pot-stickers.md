Lately we've been craving for pot stickers. We also wanted to write a recipe for pot stickers since the first day we started this blog. The timing was perfect so we spent a good part of the weekend handcrafting these delicious dumplings. Nico suggested that we use kale and corn for the filling. I have never seen kale used in chinese cuisine but after giving a try I am very satisfied with the results.

These little pot stickers are crunchy, slightly chewy and the filling works perfectly. To go with them, I made a simple dipping sauce with black vinegar and chilli bean sauce. If you don't have these ingredients on hand, a mix of soy sauce and sriracha makes a good alternative.

To shape the dumplings, I just folded square wonton wrappers into triangles. It's a simple shape that requires no special skill. Of course, you can use other shapes, just make sure to seal the dumplings properly.

_Nico's wine pairing: Riesling is often suggested for asian cuisine and it would be a good choice for these pot stickers. The residual sugar of the wine should pair well with the corn._
