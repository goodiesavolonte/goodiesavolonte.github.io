I always liked to combine asparagus & bacon. I think the subtle flavors of asparagus and the smokyness of the bacon compliment each other very well. One of my favorite side recipes is roasted bacon wrapped asparagus. Pair that with a nice and juicy steak and you're in for a treat. I just discovered another way of combining asparagus and bacon together. I wanted to make a soup with asparagus and was looking for another ingredient. I thought about bacon and although it sounded a bit silly a first, I gave it a try.

The first step in the recipe is to make asparagus soup so if you don't want bacon, that's fine, skip the rest and you're done. It's great on its own too. What I wanted to avoid was too much fat going into the soup but also a very smooth texture. The bacon I used was very fatty so I rendered the fat as much as I could while keeping the bacon moist and not too crispy. I think this helped blending it into the soup without leaving any hard bits. On the other side, the fat left in the bacon helped making a good emulsion and the result was a very smooth and creamy texture. In other words, yum!

    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      2 bunch of asparagus, trimmed and cut in 1/2 inch
    </li>
    <li>
      1 medium shallots, minced
    </li>
    <li>
      4 cloves garlic, minced
    </li>
    <li>
      800ml low-sodium vegetable stock
    </li>
    <li>
      10 strips bacon
    </li>
    <li>
      olive oil
    </li>
    <li>
      ground black pepper
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat up a pot on medium heat, add olive oil, garlic and shallot. Cook until soft and lightly golden. Add stock and asparagus, and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Using a hand blender, blend the soup until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large pan, fry bacon strips until a large part of the fat has rendered. The bacon should still be pliable and not completely fried. To cook the bacon strips evenly, use another pan to keep the bacon flat (optional).
    </li>
    <li>
      Add bacon to the soup and blend until smooth. Adjust seasoning with black pepper (and salt if needed). Serve hot in a bowl or deep plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      (Optional) Top with fried bacon and asparagus heads.
