Fall is my favourite season of the year. The sunny and cooler weather, beautiful colours of the maple leaves and soaking up in warming spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and ginger. Light up some candles, take a warm relaxing bath, sip on a cup of golden mylk or chai latte. I can go on and on about how i much i love every moment of Fall. 

Apples are abundant in Autumn. Apple crisp is definitely a frequently baked goods in our house. It’s easy to whip up and enjoy any time of the day.

This healthy dessert is packed with fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals. Coconut sugar is a healthy sweetener alternative. It has a low glycemic index which doesn’t spike up blood glucose level like refined sugar would. Plus the amazing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of cinnamon. 
  

Happy baking !
