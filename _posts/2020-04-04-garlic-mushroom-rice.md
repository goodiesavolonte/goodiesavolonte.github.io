I’m a huge garlic lover. I like them prepared in all forms, raw, cooked, fermented, you name it. 
This dish is packed with garlic and oyster mushroom. It is a simple nutritious meal. Mushrooms in general are high in antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Oyster mushrooms are one of the mushrooms containing the highest protein content, 100g contains 3.3g of protein. This mushroom has a meaty texture. My kids said it smelled like chicken when i was cooking this dish. Turmeric is potent in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Cumin aids in digestion and is rich in iron. All the components of the dish makes it a wonderful immune support meal! 

Make sure to add a generous amount of oil when cooking the mushrooms, you want it to have a slightly crunchy texture.
