Over the years, I have tried many variations of hummus. I started with the classic hummus with homemade tahini then less traditional versions like roasted red pepper, sundried tomatoes and roasted garlic to name a few. Our new favorite is grilled corn and jalapeños with lime. It doesn&#8217;t have many ingredients but each of them sing in this hummus. It&#8217;s sweet, fresh and hot but the best is the smokiness.

I start off by cooking the corn in the oven. Steaming or boiling also works. Next, I want to add smoky flavors to the corn and jalapeños. The best would be to use a grill with wood or charcoal but that&#8217;s not always possible. I use a broiler but I would use a gas stove if I had one (I miss my gas stove!). For the jalapeños, what you want is the skin to peel off easily, it&#8217;s okay if you burn them a little, it will just taste better. You don&#8217;t want to go that far with the corn, just a little grilling is fine. To keep this fresh, I add lime zest and juice, and a bit of coriander. Of course, you can adjust the level of spiciness to your liking by using less jalapeños. In the end it&#8217;s hot but it doesn&#8217;t have the burning sensation of fresh chillies so don&#8217;t be afraid.
  
Also, I don&#8217;t bother removing the skin from the chickpeas but if you&#8217;re after a hummus that is extra smooth, then you might want to consider that.

You can serve the hummus with bread (by the way, this is homemade too!), tortillas or some carrots and celery sticks.

    Grilled Corn & Jalapeño Lime Hummus
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Yields approx. 3 cups
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 ear of corn
    </li>
    <li>
      3 medium jalapeños
    </li>
    <li>
      1 can chickpeas (approx. 400g)
    </li>
    <li>
      1 lime
    </li>
    <li>
      1 bunch coriander
    </li>
    <li>
      4-5 tbsp olive oil
    </li>
    <li>
      salt
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 400F. Wrap the ear of corn in foil and bake for 25 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the corn is cool enough to be handled, halve the ear of corn and the jalapeños lengthwise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place on a baking pan and coat lightly with olive oil. Broil in the oven for about 5 minutes until the jalapeños have darkened and the skin peels off easily. Watch carefully to not burn them. Remove jalapeños from the pan and return the corn to the oven 5 more minutes or until slightly brown.
    </li>
    <li>
      Peel off the skin from the jalapeños and remove the seeds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drain and rinse the chickpeas.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the cob in upright position and slice along it to separate the kernels from the cob.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rinse the lime. Zest and juice it.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a food processor, put the chickpeas, corn, jalapeños, zest, olive oil and half of the lime juice. Mix until smooth. Adjust seasoning with salt and the rest of the juice. Add a bit more olive oil if it&#8217;s not smooth enough.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rinse coriander. Before serving, chop and sprinkle on top of the hummus.
    </li>
  </ol>
