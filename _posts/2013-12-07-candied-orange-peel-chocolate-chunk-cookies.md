If you&#8217;ve been following our blog, you may have noticed that we like to experiment with ingredients and flavors. Of course, it&#8217;s not always like that, especially during the week when cooking the daily lunches and dinners, we usually stick to what we know. But we always try to cook something new during the weekend to make it more interesting. I guess we have the same approach for this blog. We could write about another double chocolate chip cookie recipe but I think the internet has so many great recipes already that I don&#8217;t think it would be interesting for you to read. Now, what if I add candied orange peel?

<!--more-->

I&#8217;ve already talked about my love for orange and chocolate not so long ago when I made this [Pumpkin Chocolate Chips & Orange Zest Cake](http://www.goodiesavolonte.com/2013/10/14/pumpkin-chocolate-chips-orange-zest-cake/). I thought I&#8217;d try something new this time with some leftover candied orange peel I had in the fridge. And like that, they ended up on my double chocolate chip cookies. If you like orange and chocolate, you must try these cookies. They are rich and chocolaty but the orange peel brings a fresh zesty touch to the cookies.

Candied orange peel can be bought in store if you want to save some time but if you feel like making them, like I did, here&#8217;s a [simple recipe](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simple-candied-orange-peel). I should warn you that it takes some time, especially the drying part, so plan ahead. I also skip the last sugar coat because, well, it&#8217;s a lot of sugar.

  <p>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span style="line-height: 14px;">Mix flour, salt and sift in the cocoa powder and baking soda in a medium bowl.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix dark brown sugar, molasses and granulated sugar in a small bowl. Use the back of a spoon to break any lumps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a scale to measure the eggs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cream the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment in medium-low speed. The consistency should be like mayonnaise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the sugar mixture and mix for 4 minutes, until fluffy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the eggs and mix on low speed for 15-30 seconds. Over mixing will affect the result of the cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the flour mixture in two additions and mix on low speed for 15-30 seconds each.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the chocolate chunks, pulse on low speed about 10 times to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Refrigerate the dough for 30 mins. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or one month in the freezer. Frozen dough needs to defrost in the refrigerator overnight and bring to room temperature before baking.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 325F. Position the racks in the upper and lower third of the oven and place silpat or parchment paper on two baking pans.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a scale to divide the dough into 12 balls. Top with candied orange peels, pressing them gently into the dough.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 20-23 minutes in a standard oven. Â Switch the pans halfway through baking.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the pans on a cooling rack for 5-10 minutes, then transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely.
    </li>
  </ol>
