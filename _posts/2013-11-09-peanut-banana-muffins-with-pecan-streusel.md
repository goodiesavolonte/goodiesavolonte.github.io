Being a stay-at-home mom is no easy job. Simon is a little boy full of energy and one of our biggest challenges is to keep him busy. We are always trying to find new activities to burn all that energy of his. The more he's active, the better he sleeps, and that means a happy toddler. Recently, we were thrilled to see the opening of the new aquarium in Toronto, which is within walking distance from our apartment. The great thing about it is that it's very kid friendly and Simon loves it. He makes a fish face every morning to tell us that he wants to go. So we've been going there twice a week.

Whenever Simon and I go out, I always bring him a few snacks. That generally includes some biscuits and fruits. Apart from berries that he loves, his favorite is probably banana. While he loves banana, he would not eat overripe ones. Actually, Nico and I don't like them either but they are perfect for baking, whether it's in bread, cake or muffins. I've been making these banana muffins for the last couple weeks and I simply love them. They are moist and fluffy, and the pecan streusel adds a nice texture.

You can actually use that streusel for other recipes, like crumble. The amount listed below will yield enough for couple batches of muffins. I just keep it in the freezer for whenever I need it, up to a month.
