Every couple has their classic recipes. This quinoa salad is one of ours. Nico actually came up with the recipe. It has rich flavors yet it is light and refreshing. I find it perfect for a quick lunch but you can also serve it as a side (it&#8217;s great with barbecue ribs!). I can hear you thinking &#8220;great, another quinoa salad&#8221;, but I really think you&#8217;ll enjoy it if you give it a try.

It&#8217;s made with simple ingredients: tomato, garlic, parsley. Nothing too fancy here, except maybe for the pine nuts. The tomatoes and garlic are first roasted which brings a nice sweetness to the salad. I know some people are afraid of garlic but raw and roasted garlic are miles away. Then you have the toasted pine nuts for added texture and richness. And finally parsley, which is almost the main ingredient. Yes, you&#8217;ll need a big bunch, and preferably the flat kind.

_Nico&#8217;s wine pairing: You could probably go with any color as long as it&#8217;s not too powerful. I would go with a light juicy and spicy red like Morgon (Gamay)._

    Roasted Cherry Tomatoes & Parsley Quinoa Salad
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Serves 2 as main, 4 as side
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 cup quinoa
    </li>
    <li>
      1 pint cherry tomatoes
    </li>
    <li>
      3 cloves garlic, halved
    </li>
    <li>
      2 cups chopped parsley (leaves and stems)
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 cup pine nuts
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tbsp white balsamic vinegar
    </li>
    <li>
      2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
    </li>
    <li>
      salt and pepper
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the quinoa, bring back to a boil and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until fluffy and water has evaporated, for about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool down with the lid on.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wash and halve tomatoes. Remove any seed and juice. In a bowl, add tomatoes, add about a tbsp olive oil, a good pinch of salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Coat tomatoes evenly. Place on a baking pan cut side up, along with the garlic. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour at 325F. Tomatoes should be slightly chewy but not completely dehydrated.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a pan on medium heat, add the pine nuts and toast for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan periodically to get an even light browning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rinse and chop parsley.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a small bowl, add balsamic vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir to desolve the salt. Adjust seasoning and add olive oil.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a big bowl, add the quinoa (room temperature), parsley, tomatoes, pine nuts and the dressing. Mix well. Serve.
    </li>
  </ol>
