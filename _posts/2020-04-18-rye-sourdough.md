Sourdough bread is made from flour, water,and salt. It is fermented with wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. Long hours of fermentation breaks down the flour which increases digestibility. Rye flour has a deep distinct flavour and is higher in fiber and phytonutrients than wheat. Gluten in rye is not as elastic as wheat therefore it results in a more dense and hearty loaf of bread. 

This is an easy way to prepare a nutrient dense loaf of sourdough bread. It requires minimal labour.
