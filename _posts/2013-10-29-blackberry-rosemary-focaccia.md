I really love when I combine two ingredients for the first time and it magically works. That&#8217;s what happened to us this weekend when we made this bread. Sometimes, a combination sounds good but the magic is missing when executed. But that&#8217;s not the case with blackberry and rosemary, these two are natural. They even sounds like two sisters.

I think we started to realize that when we started to smell the sweet perfume coming from the oven. It was probably worth making it just go get that scent in the apartment. It was a divine combination of sweet fruit and pine forest. Nico said it smelled like a great Pauillac (a fine Bordeaux wine).

The only downside is that there wasn&#8217;t enough in the bread. After all it&#8217;s a bread, not a pie or a tart. But it was enough to keep you want more which is kind of the idea. I really can&#8217;t wait to try this in other ways. In the mean time, here&#8217;s a great focaccia recipe that I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy.
