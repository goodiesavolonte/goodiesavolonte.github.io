As the weather is slowly getting colder, it seriously starts to reflect on our cooking. The traditional soup is back on our table. Our pumpkin week is still ongoing, so guess what kind of soup we made? Pumpkin! (okay, that wasn&#8217;t too hard) But let&#8217;s be honest, the true star ingredient in this soup is the roasted garlic. I&#8217;ve already mentioned it here, once it&#8217;s roasted, garlic becomes sweet and nutty (and no bad breath!). We use it quite a lot but never thought about using it in a soup. And it worked beautifully. It gave a richness to our soup that we would have never expect.

This soup is very simple. The first step is to roast the garlic. Once this is done, it takes 10 minutes to finish it up. That&#8217;s possible because we use our pre-made pumpkin purée (recipe [here](http://www.goodiesavolonte.com/2013/10/07/how-to-make-pumpkin-puree/ "How to make pumpkin purée")). If you don&#8217;t have any, that&#8217;s fine, just replace it with raw pumpkin pieces in our recipe and cook covered with broth until soft. The rest is identical. The measurements we give for the liquids are an approximation, you can adjust them to your liking. If you prefer a thinner soup, add more. Less if you want a thicker consistency. Milk is optional if you prefer a dairy-free soup. Finally, If you want to make this soup look pretty, you can top it with sliced green onions and fried garlic and drizzle with olive oil.

Stay tuned for our last pumpkin recipe this weekend!
