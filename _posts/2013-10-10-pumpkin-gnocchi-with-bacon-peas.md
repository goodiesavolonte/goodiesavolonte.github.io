I don&#8217;t know for you but I love everything homemade. There is a satisfaction to make something by yourself that really can&#8217;t be matched. More and more Nico and I are making homemade goods. We stopped buying bread few months ago and we now make our own every couple days (you should see our stock of flour!). We recently made our own noodles and there is a lot more we want to try, from pickles to bacon and even cheese. Gnocchi is also one of the things we make at home.

Like bread, gnocchi is one of our favorite homemade things. I think it&#8217;s just the feeling of doing something with your own hands, like kneading, shaping. This was our first time making pumpkin gnocchi. Usually we stick to the classic potato version. We made 3 batches to experiment and see what was working best. Overall, I found pumpkin gnocchi to be easier than the potato ones. The starch from the potato can be tricky at times, making the dough sticky. This was not an issue with the pumpkin. I only found the dough a bit soft and difficult to roll into a long snake. Not a big deal, I just made them shorter starting with smaller pieces of dough. The key is still to find the right amount of flour. Too much and you end up with tough, chewy gnocchis. Too little and the gnocchis are mushy and don&#8217;t hold their shape. If you&#8217;re unsure, the best way is to add your flour gradually and test a single gnocchi each time.

I like to pan fry the gnocchis after boiling them. That way it&#8217;s crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Throw in some bacon and green peas, top with shaved parmesan and you&#8217;re golden!

    Pumpkin Gnocchi with Bacon & Peas
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <em>Serves 2</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 cup pumpkin purée
    </li>
    <li>
      1 egg yolk
    </li>
    <li>
      1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 cup grated parmesan
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tsp salt
    </li>
    <li>
      1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
    </li>
    <li>
      4 bacon slices
    </li>
    <li>
      2/3 cup green peas
    </li>
    <li>
      1 sprig sage
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tbsp olive oil
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a bowl, mix pumpkin purée, egg yolk, parmesan, salt and nutmeg until combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add 1 cup of the flour and work with a spatula until a ball of dough is formed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a big pinch of salt.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, transfer the dough to a floured surface. If the dough is moist or very sticky add 2 tbsp of the remaining flour. Repeat until you have a dough that is workable. It should be smooth and not stick (a little is ok, just make sure your surface is floured).
    </li>
    <li>
      When the water is boiling, pinch a small ball of dough and add it to the water. Cook until it floats, wait for 30 seconds and take out from the water with a slotted spoon. Try the gnocchi. It should be soft but hold its shape well. Too soft, add more flour and repeat the test until you like the consistency.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cut the dough in 4 smaller pieces. Roll out into a snake shape about 2/3 inch wide and cut into 2/3 inch pieces. Gently press each piece with your thumb against a fork (or gnocchi board), then roll down the fork into a C shape. Sprinkle some flour over the gnocchis if needed to make sure they don&#8217;t stick.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare a bowl of iced water. Cook the gnocchis in boiling water until they float. Leave for 30 seconds, drain and put into the iced water for 30 seconds. Drain and set aside on a plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cut bacon into 1/2 inch pieces. Fry in a large pan on medium high heat until they begin to crisp. Set aside on paper towel.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove extra oil from the pan, add olive oil and sage and fry for 30 seconds. Add gnocchis and toss until evenly golden brown. Add green peas and bacon, toss for another minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve with shaved parmesan.
    </li>
  </ol>
