I wish we could live by the ocean. That way I could get fresh seafood everyday from the local fishermen. What is better than buying seafood that is fresh off the boat? When we were in Shanghai, we use to get seafood from the local market. As long as you get there early in the morning, you are guaranteed to find the freshest seafood of the day. Agh. . . we really miss it. It has been rather difficult for us to find good seafood around the city. You can always find local markets or fishmongers offering good quality produce in China or France. I&#8217;m sure Toronto has a few good spots, I mean the best restaurants must get their seafood from somewhere. . .but it&#8217;s just not as convenient.

This dish just takes 20 minutes and I guarantee you&#8217;ll be licking your fingers while having it. The combination of the garlic and the browned, almost caramelized butter is just magic. The best way to have it is to leave the prawns whole (with the shell on) so I recommend getting fresh or even better, live ones. Unfortunately, this is hard to come by in Toronto so I had to get frozen prawns. I removed the shell because I was making a salad but the recipe stays the same.
  
It doesn&#8217;t take long to cook (no more than 5-6 minutes, depending on the size of your prawns) but timing and heat is important. The goal is to get a good caramelization without burning and overcooking the prawns. It&#8217;s not hard but pay attention to the pan. Oh, and if you cook the prawns whole, do yourself a favor, use your fingers to eat them, you won&#8217;t regret it.
